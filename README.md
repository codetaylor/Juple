## Juple
Juple is a Java library that can be used to convert Java objects into a Tuple Markup Language (TML) representation. It can also be used to convert a TML string to an equivalent Java object. Juple can also convert TML to node trees that are searchable by patterns.

The [Tuple Markup Language](https://github.com/judnich/TupleMarkup) specification was originally written by John Judnich.

Juple uses modified code from [Google's Gson](https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/) which is released as open-source under the [Apache Liscense, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

### Why Juple?
Juple was created to combine the simplicity and elegance of John Judnich's Tuple Markup Language with the versatility and power of Google's Gson.

The initial idea for Juple spawned during development of the PC game, [Lodestar: Stygian Skies](https://lodestargame.com/home). We wanted something versatile and powerful, something we could use to easily load data into arbitrary Java classes. TML was recommended as an alternative to JSON and Juple was born.

### What is in this repository?
Documentation:
* **README.md** this file
* **USER_GUIDE.md** illustrates how to use Juple ([link](https://github.com/codetaylor/Juple/blob/master/USER_GUIDE.md))
* **SYNTAX.md** highlights how Juple interprets TML  ([link](https://github.com/codetaylor/Juple/blob/master/SYNTAX.md))
* **LICENSE** the license  ([link](https://github.com/codetaylor/Juple/blob/master/LICENSE))

The `com.sudoplay.juple` package contains several classes of interest:
* **Juple** serializes and deserializes Java objects to and from TML.
* **JupleBuilder** builds a Juple instance with user defined settings.
* **TMLNodeTreeParser** parses TML into a pattern searchable node tree.
* **TMLReader** is a wrapper for java.io.Reader with methods to assert syntax and read data.
* **TMLWriter** is a wrapper for java.io.Writer with methods to assert syntax and write data.

## Example

It is very simple to create a Java object from its TML representation using Juple.

######TML
```java
[
    [ name | Ethereal Filcher ]
    [ life | 22 ]
    [ location |
        [ x | 6.2 ]
        [ y | 5.4 ]
        [ z | -3.14 ]
    ]
    [ ethereal | true ]
]
```
######Java Objects
```java
public class Vector3f {
    public float x, y, z;
    
    public Vector3f() {}
}

public class Monster {
    private String name;
    private int life;
    private Vector3f location;
    private boolean ethereal;
    
    public Monster() {}
}
```
######Java
```java
Juple juple = new Juple();
Monster monster = juple.fromTML(reader, Monster.class);
```
